# 👋 Hi

My name is Elijah. I am a student passionate about programming.
When i was 8 years old i knew i wanted to do programming. I always was the guy everyone 
go to for anything computer advice. Even if i didnt know how to do something, I could just figure it
out with logic. i started programming at 10 years old. When i was introduced to scratch at 9 1/2 . I hated it because i knew it was 
fake programming. So at 10 years old i started C++. In the end i took a break from C++ due to traumatic moments in my life leaving me with PTSD.
So in the end i forgot much of C++ and started python. Now i have made strides 100x farther than when is was 10.
And now im working on relearning C++ and C.
